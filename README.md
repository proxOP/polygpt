# polygpt

## Changelog (quick notes)

- Updated PolyGPT classes to make `org_id` checks backward compatible (storage and agent loading fallbacks).
- Added a `fraud_detection_prompt` entry to standardized prompts.
- Collected additional dataset samples for the verification journey (multi-phone recaptures).
- Developed Auto-CAM prototype v2 capable of generating CAM reports (see `tools/auto_cam_v2.py`).
- Conducted experiments using DINOv3 as a potential approach for the verification pipeline (see `experiments/dinov3_notes.md`).

See the repository for prototypes and notes.
